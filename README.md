### ¡Welcome! 🙌

<h2 width="100%">👨‍ About me: </h2>

My name is Gaston Frissiones, I am from Buenos Aires, Argentina.

I am a recently graduated Full Stack developer, passionate about learning, challenges, and very curious. I consider myself proactive, responsible, empathetic, and focused on achieving all objectives quickly and effectively. Since I was young, I have had an interest in technology, but life took me down different paths. That's why I decided to make a change and venture into this fascinating world of web and software development.

That's how I found and started studying at Henry, and now I am in search of that first opportunity to continue learning and growing as a professional, in order to create and contribute solutions to this ever-changing world. I have had the opportunity to travel extensively and experience different cultures, which has made me open-minded, cosmopolitan, and easily adaptable. I am highly committed and responsible when it comes to my work and I am constantly seeking training and updating my skills.

Regarding my previous work experience before entering the world of technology, I was in charge of conducting, coordinating, planning, budgeting, negotiations, public and institutional relations, design, press, and organizing events for various book launch campaigns at an advertising agency. I also have experience in international sales of French crystals and silverware, porcelain, etc., as well as in the management of temporary rental apartments.

In terms of my academic background, I pursued a degree in Social Communication with a focus on Advertising. I completed two full years of a Bachelor's degree in Economics and also completed an English as a Second Language course in Los Angeles, CA, USA. Additionally, I completed my studies as a Full Stack Web Developer at Soy Henry, gaining knowledge in React.js, Redux, Node.js, Express.js, PostgreSQL, Sequelize, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML.
